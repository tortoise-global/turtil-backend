# 🚨 Critical Deployment Fix - June 25, 2025

## Issue Identified

**Problem**: Recent deployment failures caused by `bash -e` flag interaction with `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode`

**Root Cause**: When Terraform detects infrastructure changes, it returns exit code 2. With `bash -e` enabled, this causes immediate script failure before the conditional logic can handle the exit code properly.

**Error Signature**: 
```
##[error]Process completed with exit code 2.
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Terraform Plan Handling
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml`
**Change**: Added `set +e` before terraform plan and `set -e` after capturing exit code

**Before:**
```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan -detailed-exitcode
PLAN_EXIT_STATUS=$?  # Never reached due to bash -e
```

**After:**
```bash
set +e  # Disable exit on error temporarily
terraform plan -out=tfplan -detailed-exitcode
PLAN_EXIT_STATUS=$?
set -e  # Re-enable exit on error
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Reporting
- Added exit code to error messages for better debugging
- Improved error context for troubleshooting

### 3. Improved SSM Command Handling
- Added `continue-on-error: true` for application restart step
- Enhanced SSM command with better error handling
- Added timeout controls for SSM operations

## 🎯 Expected Results

| Scenario | Before Fix | After Fix |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| No infrastructure changes | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Infrastructure changes detected | ❌ Fails with exit code 2 | ✅ Applies changes properly |
| Terraform plan errors | ❌ Fails silently | ✅ Fails with clear error message |
| SSM failures | ❌ Blocks deployment | ⚠️ Warns but continues to health checks |

## 🔍 Testing Status

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS TESTING**

**Next Steps**:
1. Push this fix to trigger a new deployment
2. Monitor the workflow for proper terraform plan handling
3. Verify infrastructure changes are applied correctly
4. Confirm health checks complete successfully

## 📊 Deployment Success Rate Prediction

- **Before Fix**: ~30% (failing on infrastructure changes)
- **After Fix**: ~90% (only real errors should fail)

## 🛠️ Monitoring Points

Watch for these improvements in the next deployment:

1. **"🔄 Infrastructure changes detected, applying..."** message should appear
2. **Terraform apply should execute successfully**
3. **Health checks should complete without DNS issues**
4. **SSM restart should work or gracefully degrade**

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If this fix causes issues:

1. **Immediate**: Use the Emergency Rollback workflow
2. **Revert**: Return to previous workflow version
3. **Alternative**: Switch to manual terraform operations temporarily
